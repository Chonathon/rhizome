Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations.

Focus on:
- Time complexity and algorithmic efficiency
- Memory usage and allocations
- Unnecessary iterations or redundant operations
- Caching opportunities
- Database query optimization (if applicable)
- Bundle size and lazy loading (if applicable)
